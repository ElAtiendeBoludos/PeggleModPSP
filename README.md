Requirements: Owning a legal copy of the Peggle Deluxe game.

### Installation Guide:

2- Download 7x7m.bms Script for QuickBMS: http://aluigi.org/papers/bms/7x7m.bms

3- Locate where your game files for Peggle are located. If you are using Steam you can easily find them using the Browse Local Files feature. You want to find main.pak

4- Open QuickBMS and select the 7x7m.bms script

5- Select main.pak

6- Select that same folder where main.pak is located to dump the unpacked main.pak

7- Rename main.pak to main.pak.bak to make it unreadable to the game

8- Replace the folders with the new ones included in this mod. 

/AlternateFiles is not needed to make the game work. They just contain AlternateFiles

---

Optional: If you wish to use Scuffed Ohne instead of the custom artwork you can find these files under /AlternateFiles Bjorn.jp2 and Bjorn_.gif 
These 2 files should be dragged into /images/mainmenu to replace the custom artwork. 

When launching the games there should be no errors.
