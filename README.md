Requirements: Owning a legal copy of the Peggle Deluxe game.

### Installation Guide:

Download QuickBMS: http://aluigi.org/papers/quickbms.zip

Download 7x7m.bms Script for QuickBMS: http://aluigi.org/papers/bms/7x7m.bms

Locate where your game files for Peggle are located. You want to find main.pak

Open QuickBMS and select the 7x7m.bms script

Next select main.pak

Select that same folder where main.pak is located to dump the unpacked main.pak

Rename main.pak to main.pak.bak to make it unreadable to the game

Replace the folders with the new ones included in this mod. 

/AlternateFiles is not needed to make the game work. They just contain AlternateFiles

---

Optional: If you wish to use Scuffed Ohne instead of the custom artwork you can find these files under /AlternateFiles Bjorn.jp2 and Bjorn_.gif 
These 2 files should be dragged into /images/mainmenu to replace the custom artwork. 

When launching the games there should be no errors.
